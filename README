This package has the Vyatta configuration/operational templates and scripts for VRRP.

For Python development with VCI setup running unit tests requires the following (and unit tests before and after changes are required!)
Install virtualenv: pip3 install virtualenv (on python > 3.3 the venv module is included in the install)
Setup virtual environment: virtualenv <env_name> or python3 -m venv <env_name>
# I've used venv here, and added it to .gitignore
source <env_name>/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Running unit tests
I recommend adding an alias like this to your aliases file
alias run_test="ptw -- -vv -s --flake8 --pep8 --spec --cov=vyatta/ tests/"
calling this from the vyatta-vrrp directory will also have the tests run every time
a file is written. (Tmux/screen with the test in one pannel and the code in another is
a good workflow for this).
Going forward PRs will require the output of
pytest -s --cov=vyatta/ tests/
pep8 and flake8 tests aren't required to pass but best effort should be made to conform
to these tools. VIM has plugins that can run on file write and execute flake8,
emacs has similar tools

Running acceptance tests
