# DANOS VRRP VCI package

This package contains the software to configured and operate VRRP functionality in DANOS and it's derivatives.

## Getting started

The software here is written in python3 and requires features from python 3.6, if you have an earlier version of python you will not be able to use this software.

### Prerequisites
To develop on this project you need:
* python3 >= 3.6
* pipenv (pip3 install pipenv or sudo apt install pipenv)

Other dependencies are taken care of in the Pipfile.
Pipenv documentation can be found [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) if you have trouble installing it.


### Setting up a dev environment

To development this software and run unit tests you will need to do the following after setting up the prerequisites.

From the top level of the git repo:

1. Setup virtual environment: pipenv install
1. Enter virtual environment: pipenv shell
1. Setup development environment: pipenv install --dev

You will then have everything you need to start developing.

## Testing

Tests should be written for every change and we should strive for 100% coverage

### Running unit tests
I recommend adding an alias like this to your aliases file:
    alias run_test="ptw -- -vv -s --flake8 --pep8 --spec --cov=vyatta/"

Calling this from the top level of the git repo will also have the tests run every time a file is written.

Tmux/screen with the test in one panel and the code in another is a good workflow for this, or use an IDE like VSCode with the tests running in the shell underneath.

Pull Requests into the repository will require output from the following command:
    pytest -s --flake8 --cov=vyatta/


The unit tests are also linked into the build process and if the tests fail then the build fails.

At some point in the future the unit tests will also be run via a CI service.

### Running acceptance tests
